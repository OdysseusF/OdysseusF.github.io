_Informal Logic_ is the industry standard for the field of _Analytic Philosophy_.  When doing Analytic Philosophy research, one needs to consistently produce logically valid arguments.  The community checks for logical validity in the sense that pointing out a fallacy in a recent paper is itself sufficient for publication.  This is not the case in other disciplines.  As such, conceptual obfuscation and logical invalidities are not weeded out.  

In the theoretical machine learning research community, for instance, there are many people who were not trained in logical reasoning.  Consequently, the claims, the reasoning, and the argumentation of their papers are incoherent and confused.  Even though the theoretical machine learning papers do contain theorems (whose _mathematical rigours_ are checked through an alternative mechanism), the papers also contain a large portion of informal reasoning.  The development of philosophical concepts, the organisation of ideas, and the advancement of arguments, all fall under the realm of informal logic.  According to some conventions, mathematical proofs are given in the appendix; in these cases, the main text of papers are entirely written in natural language and therefore governed by informal logic.

To move forward, one still needs to prove actual theorems, but identifying which concepts are ill-understood, which questions need to be answered, and which works do not satisfactorily explain the empirical phenomena, are all best done by people who know informal logic.  In summary, knowing how to do analytic philosophy is among the most important ingredient to doing theoretical machine learning research.
