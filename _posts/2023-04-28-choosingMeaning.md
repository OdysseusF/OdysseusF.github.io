[Skepticism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism/) is the school of thought which tells you that you can never be really sure about anything.  There are many reasonable formulations for it, but in this article, we restrict to the stupid versions -- the ones I have encountered in real life.  

Stupid skepticism can not be argumentatively refuted.  No matter what we try to establish, they can always easily reject by saying, "how can you be sure?" "what if you are wrong?" "who the fuck cares?" and "what's the point?"  To reject stupid skepticism, we must turn to means other than argumentation.

For someone who has attended philosophy conferences, the attractiveness of various theories is invariably associated with the attractiveness of their proponents.  My personal experience in conferences has been that the spokespeople for stupid skepticism are not among the most attractive, eloquent, erudite, wisest, or happiest people that I have met in life.  This observation alone constitutes my rejection of stupid skepticism of various forms.

In practice, stupid skepticism teaches that nothing is really meaningful and everything is a lie, a conspiracy, a scheme set up against you, or just a hopeless festival of shit and suffering.  For every aspect of life, there exists a particular school of stupid skepticism.  Three examples follow.

The socialist stupid skepticism towards careers claims, "why do you want to work?  Whatever you are working on is pointless and the only effect is for you barely earning the minimal for survival while making the rich richer."  

The environmentalist stupid skepticism towards lifestyle claims, "why are you living the way you are?  Why should you the breeder of the sinners be?  Within a few years the Dooms Day will come and Mother Earth will be utterly destroyed (due to global warming, which was presciently known to the Mayans).  Whatever you do will have no meaning or impact and human race will come to an extinction."  

The feminist stupid skepticism towards marriage states, "why do you want to marry a man?  If you do, why do you need to stay loyal, do the housework, bear children, or financially contribute?  The institution of marriage was set up by straight men to oppress women, to preserve patriarchy, to maintain stability of the societies, and to dominate innocent girls out of their freedom, happiness, or rights."

The feminist stupid skepticism is just another garden variety stupid skepticism position -- of a tedious sort.  When people believe in it, we cannot bring them back via logic and reason.  For the doubter, it is argumentatively impossible to establish the real point of marriage -- to maintain social order, to find a financial partner, to have a long-term roommate relationship, to have long-term free sex, to have tax reduction, and to have respectable social business card?  Sure, these instrumental purposes may be granted, but surely marriage is not sacred, not romantic, and in no way related to love.  One clearly does not need marriage in life.  One clearly does better staying out of marriage in life.  There is no point in getting married.  In fact, it originated as the evil straight men's conspiracy to turn women into victims.

One needs means other than reason and logic to reject the stupid feminist skepticism.  One possibility is to look at not what it rejects but what it stands for.  What do stupid skeptics stand for?  What makes their existence worthy and noble?  Suppose that you do reject men, marriage, and the indissoluble bond chosen by God between a Man and a Woman.  Suppose that you think marriage (with totally committed love and deep spiritual bond) is not worth having and children are not worth bringing into the world.  What, then, do you believe in?  Why is your life still worth living?  What gives your life meaning?  Is there still any Nobility left in you?

"Lastly, it could be demonstrated that the finality of the alliance of two human beings, which Christian faith knows to be established by the Yes of love on which marriage is based, also has its roots here. Indissoluble marriage is in fact only comprehensible and feasible on the basis of faith in God's henceforward irrevocable decision, embodied in Christ, in favor of "marriage" with mankind (cf Eph 5: 22-33). It stands or falls with this faith; in the long run, it is just as impossible outside this faith as it is necessary within it. And once again it should be stated that it is precisely this apparent fixation on the decision of one moment in life that enables man to march forward, to consolidate himself stage by stage, while the continual annulment of such decisions keeps sending him back to the beginning again and condemns him to a circular motion that encloses itself in the fiction of eternal youth and thus refuses to accept the totality of human existence. " (Joseph Ratzinger Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI 1968, _Introduction to Christianity_)

In general, we should choose meaning over skepticism.  We can reject a set of values, but we should reject the set after careful consideration and not out of spite, past wounds, or psychological illness.  For each set of values that we reject, we should also have in its place an alternative set that supplies our lives with meaning, purpose, and fulfilment.  This is the correct attitude towards life.  One does not need to be well-versed in existentialist literature to understand this basic point.  We don't need to stand for every noble cause or pompous ideal spit out from professors' tongues, but we must stand for something.


        Then out spake brave Horatius,
            The Captain of the Gate:
        To every man upon this earth
            Death cometh soon or late.
        And how can man die better
            Than facing fearful odds,
        For the ashes of his fathers,
            And the temples of his gods,
        And for the tender mother
            Who dandled him to rest,
        And for the wife who nurses
            His baby at her breast,
        And for the holy maidens
            Who feed the eternal flame,
        To save them from false Sextus
            That wrought the deed of shame?

(Thomas Babington Macaulay 1842, _Lays of Ancient Rome_)
