We hereby give a brief note on the knowledge formation process in the style of applied math that we do.  The practice of applied maths that we are engaged in consists of three steps.  

First, we identify intriguing and unexplained scientific phenomena that have been collected and summarised by empirical scientists.  These data and facts ("scientists' numbers") presented in science journals, typically accompanied by explanations, mechanisms, and concepts ("scientists' ideas").  

Second, we define a collection of abstract mathematical terms ("mathematical model"), study the properties of these terms, and derive relations among them.

Third, we modify the mathematical model until the resultant properties and derived relations of the terms match up with the scientists' numbers and ideas.

(Bonus step, we leave a remark if we observe that our model has interesting mathematical properties.)

For example, Thermodynamics consists of a collection of empirical data.  While organising and understanding these experimental data, scientists have invented concepts (such as temperature and entropy) as well as their relations (such as the four laws of Thermodynamics).  Statistical Mechanics was invented as the mathematical model which, upon appropriate fine-tuning of the definitions, assumptions, and axioms, gives rise to three distinct terms, k log Sigma (E), k log omega (E), and k log Gamma (E) (c.f. Kerson Huang 1963 _Statistical Mechanics_ p 147).  As a theorem, all three terms have been proved to be 1) extensive and 2) non-decreasing, and 3) do an equally good job matching up with what Thermodynamicists call "entropy."  We arbitrarily pick one as the "entropy" and refer to it as S, in homage to the Thermodynamicists.

A counterintuitive feature follows.  In doing this line of applied math, the conclusions - already determined by the scientists - never change, but the axioms are always modified.  It is not that properties of terms follow deductively from the axioms.  It is rather that the axioms and the terms are defined inductively based on how well they give the desired conclusions.  Data are treated as _a priori_ given and "axiomatic" while the definitions are _a posteriori_ specified and adjusted for optimal performance.  We know what theorems we want to prove and then cook up things for which such theorems can be proved.

P.S.
"It has not been possible to formulate the basic laws of quantum mechanics as a logical consequence of the results of some collection of fundamental physical experiments. In other words, there is so far no known formulation of quantum mechanics that is based on **a system of axioms confirmed by experiment**. Moreover, some of the basic statements of quantum mechanics are in principle not amenable to experimental verification. Our confidence in the validity of quantum mechanics is based on the fact that all the physical results of the theory agree with experiment. Thus, only consequences of the basic tenets of quantum mechanics can be verified by experiment, and not its basic laws." (Faddeev-Yakubovskii, _Lectures on Quantum Mechanics for Mathematics Students_)
